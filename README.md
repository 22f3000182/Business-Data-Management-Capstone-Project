# The Elegant – Inventory Optimization and Sales Analysis

This project delivers a structured, data-driven analysis of **The Elegant**, a retail clothing and footwear store based in Rath, Hamirpur (Uttar Pradesh). The primary objective is to identify stock management inefficiencies, evaluate sales patterns, and derive actionable business insights to support inventory optimization and strategic decision-making.

## Project Overview

The analysis covers internal sales and stock data from **May 2024 to October 2024**, focusing on key issues such as overstocking, understocking, demand fluctuations, and profitability across various product categories. The study provides a foundation for refining procurement strategies, aligning inventory with demand, and improving overall operational performance.

1. **Proposal** – Identification of business problems, scope definition, and initial objectives
2. **Mid-Term Submission** – Preliminary analysis, data exploration, and presentation of early findings
3. **Final Report** – In-depth analysis, visualization, interpretation of results, and final recommendations
4. **Presentation** – Summary of findings, visual demonstrations, and strategic suggestions shared with stakeholders

## Key Objectives

- **Python**: Data processing, analysis, and visualization (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- **Google Colab**: Interactive coding and reporting
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data formatting and verification
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and documentation

## Data Sources

- **Sales Dataset**: Contains transaction-level data with fields such as `Date`, `Product Name`, `Category`, `Quantity Sold`, `Selling Price`, `Total Sale Value`, and `Payment Method`
